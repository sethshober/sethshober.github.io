    <h1>Why I Belong</h1>
    <p><strong>Open Information: </strong>I believe in the Mozilla Manifesto of openness, innovation, and opportunity on the Web. As technology and the world grows, we need to be ever more focused in the choices we make both on and offline. I'm looking for something I can stand behind in my work each day, in order to feel a sense of purpose, because that's going to make all the difference. </p>
    <p><strong>Empathy: </strong>It all comes down to user experience, and that's one of my passions. It's important to understand different perspectives and try to get in the shoes of the customer. You might just learn a thing or two.</p>
    <p><strong>Curiosity: </strong>Curious like a cat, right?! I believe we should constantly be asking, "Why?" We need to understand not just how things work, but why they were designed that way in the first place, and then question whether that still makes sense, or if it could use an iteration. Personally, I love to learn, and need to constantly be evolving.</p>
    <p><strong>Collaboration: </strong>I like my independence, but the best creativity is sparked organically via collaboration and chance conversation. I think it's important for all teams to collaborate in order to achieve the most diverse and strongest outcome.</p>
    <p><strong>Courage: </strong>I was once told I need to have strong opinions, but never let that get in the way of my own progression. I have opinions, and I don't mind sharing them, but I've learned to grow by learning from others opinions and evolving my own to mesh. Learning how to fail is important, but it's quite simple really. The only way to fail is to not learn from it.</p>
    <p><strong>Diligence: </strong>I can be a perfectionist sometimes, and admittedly that can slow me down, but being a part of startups and hackathons has given me first hand experience and allowed me to see the results of the MVP and the build-measure-learn feedback loop. Always remember your user.</p>
    <p><strong>Humility: </strong>People are people, and when you learn to view the world that way it opens you up to all the diversity and beauty of it. It grounds you. I'd like to think I'm humble, and I constantly try to keep that perspective. On my bedroom wall reads: <strong>Work hard. Stay humble.</strong></p>
